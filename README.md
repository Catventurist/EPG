Emotion Playing Game

Roleplaying game without a weapon. Based mostly on Cooking With Unity-assets, ment for personal practicing of using Unity3D 
5.younameit. Might include some self-made stuff too, from Blender models to scripts.

Just going through the tutorials as time goes by and changing some aspects whenever possible. Some files might have their 
own licences, claiming no rights of owning that so-called virtual property. Like someone could own an idea, that is 
logically just absurd. Copying stuff on the internet is taking nothing away from anyone, so patent trolls can suck it.

The goal of the project is to change killing to hugging and other humane means of interaction, added with dialogues based 
on emotional intelligence, broader understandng of the society as a whole, not to forget actual solutions on how to get 
from here to there. The goal is to grow up from psychopathic individual to a person who can only consider love and levels
of lack of it, instead of dualistic indoctrination and fighting without purpose.

Most of the projects seen done on Unity are based on violence, the point is to ty and make an interesting interactive 
experience for people, who like to learn more about the surrounding world and what it actually means to be a human being.
