Notes:
Vid#1: The updated Scripts constructed differently (shooting etc), Navmesh works on unity free 5+
Vid#2: Changing outdated shaders helps, shooting still not working
Vid#3: Perhaps missing the script scaling bullets; LevelScaledOnTriggerEnter
Vid#4: No new scripts, planning
vid#5: Using WorldSpaceCanvas could be easier on dmgtext
vid#6: Finally animations!
